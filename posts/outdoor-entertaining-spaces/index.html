    <article class="section"><h2>Designing the Perfect Outdoor Entertaining Space</h2>
      <p>An outdoor entertaining space is where food, friends, and the beauty of nature come together. Whether you're hosting intimate dinner parties or large celebrations, thoughtful design can create an outdoor environment that's both functional and magical.</p>
      <p>Start with a defined gathering area. This might be a patio, deck, or a level area in your garden. The space should be large enough to accommodate your typical guest count comfortably, with room for both seated dining and casual mingling. A good rule of thumb is 25 square feet per guest for a comfortable flow.</p>
      <p>An outdoor kitchen or cooking station is the centerpiece of many entertaining spaces. At minimum, a quality grill and nearby prep surface provide the essentials. More elaborate setups might include built-in grills, pizza ovens, refrigeration, sinks, and bar areas. Position cooking areas to keep the chef connected to guests rather than isolated.</p>
      <p>Fire features add warmth, ambiance, and a natural gathering point. A fire pit encourages conversation and extends the usability of your outdoor space into cooler evenings. Options range from simple portable fire bowls to elaborate built-in gas fireplaces. Consider both aesthetics and local fire codes when planning.</p>
      <p>Outdoor lighting transforms your space after sunset. Layer ambient lighting (string lights, lanterns), task lighting (over cooking and dining areas), and accent lighting (uplighting trees, illuminating pathways) to create a warm, inviting atmosphere. Solar-powered options reduce installation complexity and operating costs.</p>
      <p>Don't forget about shade and shelter. Pergolas, shade sails, retractable awnings, and large umbrellas ensure your guests are comfortable in any weather. These structures also define spaces within your outdoor area, creating distinct zones for different activities.</p>
