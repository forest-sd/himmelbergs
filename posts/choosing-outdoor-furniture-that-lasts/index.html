    <article class="section"><h2>Choosing Outdoor Furniture That Lasts: A Buyer's Guide</h2>
      <p>Outdoor furniture represents a significant investment, and choosing pieces that combine beauty, comfort, and durability ensures you'll enjoy your outdoor space for years to come. The key is understanding materials, construction quality, and how different options perform in your specific climate.</p>
      <p>Teak is widely considered the gold standard of outdoor wood furniture. Its natural oils make it resistant to moisture, insects, and decay without chemical treatment. Quality teak furniture can last 50+ years, developing a beautiful silver-gray patina over time. While expensive initially, its longevity makes it cost-effective over the long term.</p>
      <p>Aluminum is an excellent choice for those who want lightweight, rust-proof furniture that's easy to move and maintain. Powder-coated aluminum frames resist chipping and fading, and the material can be crafted into both modern and traditional designs. Look for welded (not bolted) joints for maximum durability.</p>
      <p>All-weather wicker (synthetic resin woven over aluminum frames) offers the classic look of wicker without the weather vulnerability of natural rattan. Quality synthetic wicker resists UV fading, cracking, and moisture damage, making it suitable for year-round outdoor use in most climates.</p>
      <p>Stainless steel and wrought iron offer strength and heft that lighter materials can't match. These options are ideal for windy environments and provide a substantial, permanent feel to outdoor spaces. Wrought iron requires periodic maintenance to prevent rust, while marine-grade stainless steel is virtually maintenance-free.</p>
      <p>Regardless of material, invest in quality cushions with solution-dyed acrylic fabric (like Sunbrella). These fabrics resist fading, mildew, and staining while providing exceptional comfort. Good cushions can transform even basic furniture into a luxurious outdoor seating experience.</p>
